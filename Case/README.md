# RD-10 Printable Enclosure

There are two sets of STL files, a Fusion 360 Archive, and a copy in STEP format.<br>

The STLs are grouped into two categories:  The first being the original exports in millimeters.  The second (resized), which has been resized to 10% of the orignal size.  The second set is for applications where importation assumes the design to be in imperial sizes, and creates a giant version.<br><br>

The Fusion 360 Archive can be used to modify the original design.  You're welcome...<br>

The STEP format can be used to import into other CAD software.  You're welcome...<br>

Build Note: HRA reports M3.5 x 12mm counter sunk screws are a perfect fit.<br>

If you have any issues with these files, please let me know.<br>
